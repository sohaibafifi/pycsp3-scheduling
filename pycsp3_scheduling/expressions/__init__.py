Expression functions for interval variables.

This module provides accessor functions that return expressions from interval variables:
- start_of, end_of, size_of, length_of, presence_of
- overlap_length
- start_eval, end_eval, size_eval, length_eval
- Sequence accessors (start_of_next, end_of_prev, etc.)
