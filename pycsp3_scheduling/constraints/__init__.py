Scheduling constraints.

This module provides:
- Precedence constraints: start_at_start, end_before_start, etc.
- Grouping constraints: span, alternative, synchronize
- Sequence constraints: no_overlap, first, last, before, previous
- Cumulative constraints: cumul_range, always_in
- State constraints: always_equal, always_constant, always_no_state
- Forbidden region constraints: forbid_start, forbid_end, forbid_extent
