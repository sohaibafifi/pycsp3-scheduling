    "\n",
    "In the VRPTW:\n",
    "- A fleet of **vehicles** starts and ends at a **depot**\n",
    "- Each vehicle must visit a subset of **customers**\n",
    "- Each customer has a **time window** $[e_i, l_i]$ for when service can begin\n",
    "- Each customer has a **demand** and each vehicle has **capacity**\n",
    "- **Objective**: Minimize total travel distance"
